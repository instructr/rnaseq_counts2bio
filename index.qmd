## RNA-seq Analysis Crash Course

Welcome! This crash course walks you through RNA-seq data analysis in R: From raw count matrices to functional interpretation of differentially expressed genes.

#### Learning Objectives

1.  Perform quality control of the count data.
2.  Identify the R commands needed to run a differential expression analysis using `DESeq2`.
3.  Visualize the DE results.
4.  Perform functional enrichment of the DE genes.
5.  Visualize functionally enriched categories.
